# TinDog
This is a website that I created while practicing. 
It's basically a tinder for Dogs. This website aims to connect dog owners and their furry friends to arrange playdates, walks, and perhaps even find some puppy love.
I used HTML and CSS but most importantly Bootstrap. This website was created to practice Bootstrap.
